# Feature Flag Management - API/SDK Landscape Research

## Goal

The goal of this research is to document the APIs and SDKs of existing feature flag
management tools in order to identity patterns that should be considered when
defining the OpenFeature spec.

> NOTE: This research focuses primarily on the server-side NodeJS SDKs

## Unleash

Unleash has documented the expected behavior of their client SDKs [here](https://github.com/Unleash/client-specification).

```typescript
  // isEnabled(name: string, context?: Context, fallbackFunction?: FallbackFunction): boolean;
  // isEnabled(name: string, context?: Context, fallbackValue?: boolean): boolean;
  const featureEnabled = unleash.isEnabled("test-release");
```

### Context

Context in Unleash is used to make feature state evaluation at runtime. The noteworthy properties are:

- userId
- sessionId
- remoteAddress
- environment
- appName
- properties (additional context as key-value pairs)

The context interface for NodeJS can be found
[here](https://github.com/Unleash/unleash-client-node/blob/main/src/context.ts).

### Variant

Variants are extensions to feature flags in Unleash. They allow Unleash
administrators to define customized response payloads (which can be further
customized using context). For example, if a feature flag called 'banner-color'
is enabled, the variant could return a string value specifying which color the
banner should be, using, for instance, the user's role.

The variant interfaces for NodeJS can be found [here](https://github.com/Unleash/unleash-client-node/blob/main/src/variant.ts).


```typescript
  // getVariant(name: string, context?: Context, fallbackVariant?: Variant): Variant;
  const colorVariant = unleash.getVariant("banner-color");
  // NOTE: Values are always strings but can stringified JSON
  const color = colorVariant.enabled && colorVariant.payload?.value || "#0000FF";
```

### Key findings

 - Evaluation logic is handled in the SDK and some clients support synchronous
   operations.
 - The fallback argument accepting a function provides developers the opportunity
   for more sophisticated logic when an error occurs.
 - Variants do not support integer values.
 - Some SDKs, like
   [Java](https://docs.getunleash.io/sdks/java_sdk#step-4-provide-unleash-context),
   request scoped context.
 - Initial synchronization can impact app start-up time.
 - Invalid flag IDs behave like a disabled feature.


## Flagsmith

The following is an example of a basic flag evaluation where the expected return
type is a boolean.

```typescript
  // hasFeature(key: string): Promise<boolean>;
  // hasFeature(key: string, userId: string): Promise<boolean>;
  const featureEnabled = await flagsmith.hasFeature("test-feature");
```

It's also possible to return values associated with a feature flag. These values
are returned despite the state of the flag.

```typescript
  // getValue(key: string): Promise<string | number | boolean>;
  // getValue(key: string, userId: string): Promise<string | number | boolean>;
  const value = await flagsmith.getValue("test-feature");
```

### Identity management

Users are automatically created the first time they're referenced in a flag
evaluation. Traits can be associated with a user and are persisted
server-side. It doesn't appear that traits can be removed via the SDK.

### Segments

Segments can be applied to a feature, allowing Flagsmith administrators to
override default behavior. This is done by evaluating traits associated with a
user.

### Evaluation engine

Flagsmith performs flag evaluation server-side. This service is written in
Python and can be found [here](https://github.com/Flagsmith/flagsmith-engine).

### Key findings

 - Evaluation logic is handed on the server and called via REST. However, the v2
   SDK allows developers to choose between remote or local evaluation. The
   pro/cons list can be found
   [here](https://docs.flagsmith.com/next/clients/overview#pros-cons-and-caveats).
 - Identities need to maintained outside of the flag evaluation.
 - Values are always returned, even if the flag is disabled.
 - Invalid flag IDs behave like a disabled feature and return a null value (In
   NodeJS).

## LaunchDarkly

The method names and signatures vary between languages. The following is how a
flag is evaluated in NodeJS:

```typescript
  /**
   * variation(
   *   key: string,
   *   user: LDUser,
   *   defaultValue: LDFlagValue,
   *   callback?: (err: any, res: LDFlagValue) => void
   * ): Promise<LDFlagValue>;
   */
  const value = await ld.variation("test-feature", { key: "test-user" }, false);
```

And this is that same flag in Java:

```java
  /*
  Other methods include intVariation, doubleVariation, stringVariation, and jsonValueVariation
  */
  boolean value = client.boolVariation("test-feature", user, false);
```

## Users

A user key always needs to be defined when performing a flag evaluation.
Anonymous users still need a key and should have the property `anonymous` set to
true. More information can be found
[here](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/features/user-config).

The user interface accepts the following properties:
 - key
 - secondary
 - name
 - firstName
 - lastName
 - email
 - avatar
 - ip
 - country
 - anonymous
 - custom

The user interface for NodeJS can be found
[here](https://github.com/launchdarkly/node-server-sdk/blob/master/index.d.ts#L533).

### Key findings
 - There's a `variationDetails` method that returns evaluation and error details.
 - Remote debugging option captures additional evaluation details.
 - The return type from the variation method is `any` (In NodeJS).
 - Flag variation is defined during flag creation and cannot be modified later.
 - Private user attributes can be [disabled from
   analytics](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/users/attributes#configuring-private-attribute-settings-in-your-sdk)
   while still being available for local flag evaluation.
