# Open Feature Enhancement Proposals

This repository serves as a focal point for research and experimental work.
It also enables the creation of discussions, proposals and ideation through issues.

We use OFEP: Open Feature Enhancement proposals, which comes from the lineage of [PEP](https://peps.python.org/pep-0001/) much like the Kubernetes project uses [KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/README.md)

Please follow the [OFEP Template](000-OFEP-template.md) when creating a pull request for a new OFEP document.
